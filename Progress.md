## Task: Create a Clean Architecture Template Project

### Description
Create a scalable and maintainable Flutter application template based on Clean Architecture principles, with clear separation of concerns between data, domain, and presentation layers.

### Plan
1. [X] Set up project structure
2. [X] Implement core utilities (error handling, networking, dependency injection)
3. [X] Create domain layer (entities, repository interfaces, use cases)
4. [X] Implement data layer (models, services, repository implementations)
5. [X] Set up presentation layer (screens, BLoCs)
6. [X] Document the architecture and usage
